[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/C-Pro/pg_skeleton.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/C-Pro/pg_skeleton)


This is simple skeleton for postgresql-based projects.
It includes install and uninstall scripts, one example schema (test_user) and
pgTAP tests for it.

Fork it to start your own PostgreSQL-enabled project with pgTAP tests and Travis integration.
